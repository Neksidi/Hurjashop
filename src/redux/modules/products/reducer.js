/**
*
* Reducers
*
* http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Reducers.html
*
* Actions describe the fact that something happened, but don't specify
* how the application's state changes in response. This is the job of reducers.
*
* The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.
* '' (previousState, action) => newState ''
*
* Things you should never do inside a reducer:
*
*  - Mutate its arguments;
*  - Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;
*  - Call non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() or Math.random().
